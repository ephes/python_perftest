Install compatible llvm version:
brew install homebrew/versions/llvm33 --enable-shared --with-clang --with-asan --rtti --enable-jit --enable-optimized

Install llvmpy after setting this variable:
export LLVM_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm33/bin/llvm-config-3.3

pip install -r requirements.txt does not work because it gets the
dependencies wrong. Use installation.sh. :/
